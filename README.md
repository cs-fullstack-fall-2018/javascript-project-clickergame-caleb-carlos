# javascript_project_clickerGame

Create a clicker game.

Each time a button is pressed your score increased by 1. Include a way to upgrade the value of each button click once you reach a predefined upgrade. Also, make sure an auto-clicker button is available once you hit a predefined upgrade amount. You should have at least 5 upgrades available for both the click button and autoclicker.
